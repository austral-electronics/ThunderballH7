### 4.2. Change the IP Address <a name="ip"></a>
The default IP Adress is static at 192.168.100.222.  
To change this address rapidly edit the file "LWIP/App/lwip.c" line 63 and recompile.  
Note : This setting will be erased by CubeMX's automatic code generation, and you will have to change the settings in CubeMX->LWIP->General Settings (See Chapter 5).

### 4.3. Modify and Compile the Web pages <a name="web"></a>
If you modify the web pages, you must first compile the web pages with makefsdata.exe before compiling the application.  
Put the file [makefsdata.exe](https://github.com/ARMmbed/lwip/tree/master/src/apps/httpd/makefsdata) in the folder middleware/third_party/lwip/scr/apps/httpd and run the executable.  
It will create the file fsdata.c, which must be excluded from the buid right-click on it in the project and resource configuration/exclude.  

Run in the VS Code terminal :  
```
cd .\Middlewares\Third_Party\LwIP\src\apps\http\
.\makefsdata.exe
cd ../../../../../..
``` 
### 4.4. Compile the application <a name="compile"></a>
In a VSCode Terminal :  
 - **Clean and recompile the entire project**
 ```
make clean
make -j8 all
 ```
 - **Compile modified parts of the project**
 ```
make
 ```
 - **Compile and flash the STM32 using the JTAG/SWD tool**
 ```
make FLASH=Y
 ```
### 4.5. Debug the application using the ST-LINK/V2 <a name="debug"></a>

    - Open the device manager to see the COMx port name  
    - Open a Console with PuTTY (Serial, COMx, 115200 bauds)  
    - Power up the ThunderballH7, you must see in the serial console :  

[![ThunderballH7_web_page](/SDK/images/ThunderballH7_autotest.png)](https://github.com/austral-electronics/ThunderballH7/edit/main/README.md)  
 
 - **Test RTC, Backlight, COM1 TX/CTS/RTS**  
    - Strap RTS to CTS on COM1  
    - Press "space" in the serial console  
    - You must see :  
        - the time evolve  
        - a toggle on the backlight  
        - a toggle on the COM1 CTS  

 - **Test COM2 to COM5 in RS422/RS485 mode**  
    - A RS422 point-to-point cable (!!! with terminations and bias resistors !!!) is required to send data from TX+/TX- on one COM to RX+/RX- on another.  
    - Connect TX side to COM2 and RX side to COM3 and press "space"  
    - You must see "TX on COM2, RX on COM3 OK"  
    - Strap the next COM ports and restart the test with "space" for the others 3 combinaisons.  
      
 - **Test COM2 to COM5 in RS232 RX only mode**  
    - With a Binder 620 to RS232 RX only DB9 cable (see Datasheet for wiring) and another USB <->RS232 adapter  
    - Open another PuTTY serial console (Serial, COMy, 115200 bauds)  
    - Connect this RS232_RX cable to COM2  
    - Send any character with this COM2 console, you must see "COM2:x" in the COM1 console  
    - Test COM3 to COM5

    - This method may be necessary on products using the USB device port, that do not set BOOT0 by powering with a USB-C cable.  
    - Press 'b' in the COM1 console  
    - Test the bootload with STM32CubeProgrammer

## 5. MODIFY THE DEVICE CONFIGURATION WITH STM32CUBEMX <a name="cubemx"></a>

ðŸ”´ **This template was created in early 2022 using "STM32CubeMX" 6.4.0 and "STM32Cube MCU Package for STM32H7" 1.9.1** ðŸ”´  
    
**These versions contain known bugs (Ethernet driver, HTTPD_USE_CUSTOM_FSDATA...) and have been upgraded since.**  
**Some modifications applied after the cubeMX code generation are probably no longer applicable with a newer package version.**  

**Warning : New problems appear with more recent versions of CubeMx using old package or in recent CubeMx and H7 Package.**  
**And ST doesn't provide example for Nucleo using cubeMX and LwIP and doesn't update Nucleo-H743 demos when drivers change.** 
**Changing package versions can be a laborious task.**  
     
With Windows Explorer, click "C:\git\ThunderballH7\ThunderballH7.ioc" to open CubeMX with the template configuration.  
You'll certainly need to change IP, DMAs, Baudrates, Interrupts, FATFS, FREERTOS... in your application if you use this simple template as a basis.  
The default STM32H743VIT6 Pinout is described in the datasheet and the CPU clock is adjust to the max (480Mhz).  

 - **Change IP Address Settings**
   Change the settings in CubeMX->LWIP->General Settings
  
[![ThunderballH7_web_page](/SDK/images/ThunderballH7_STM32CubeMX.png)](https://github.com/austral-electronics/ThunderballH7/edit/main/README.md)  
     
 - **Modifications applied to generated source code after CubeMX automatic code generation:**
    - Use origin web page by diseabling custom web page (@ line 93) in file "LWIP\Target\lwipopts.h": **HTTPD_USE_CUSTOM_FSDATA 0**    
    - Generate "fsdata.c" by executing "./makefsdata.exe" in the folder: "Middlewares\Third_Party\LwIP\src\apps\http"  
    - Compile the project with : make -j8 all  
     
 - **Todo creating a new project:**
    - Create the CubeMx project and follow instruction from st: https://community.st.com/s/article/How-to-create-project-for-STM32H7-with-Ethernet-and-LwIP-stack-working  
    - If it is a VScode project with a makefile, add "DATA_IN_D2_SRAM" in C defines (C_DEFS) of the makefile  
    - Exclude fsdata.c from compilation. right clic on file "fsdata.c" and then "Ressource configuration/exclude".  
      If "fsdata.c" is hidden, right clic on project and the refresh.  

## 6. FAQ & TROUBLESHOOTING <a name="faq"></a>

### 6.1. Forum <a name="forum"></a>
- [STM32 MCUs Embedded software Forum](https://community.st.com/t5/stm32-mcus-embedded-software/bd-p/mcu-embedded-software-forum)  

### 6.2. Ethernet does not work properly <a name="ethernet_pb"></a>
ðŸ”´ **There are 2 Ethernet driver bugs (H743 too fast & auto-negociation) in the "STM32Cube MCU Package for STM32H7" version 1.9.1 :** ðŸ”´  
- [PHY driver for LAN8742 issue](https://community.st.com/t5/stm32-mcus-embedded-software/stm32h7-phy-driver-for-lan8742-2s-delay/td-p/112767)  
- [Ethernet low_level_init does not handle return code from LAN8742_init](https://github.com/STMicroelectronics/STM32CubeH7/issues/261)  
- [LAN8742 startup issue](https://community.st.com/t5/stm32cubemx-mcus/h743-and-lan8742-init/m-p/570179)

Waiting for an official Fix from ST :
- We had to introduce a delay of 500 to 1500ms at the boot (main.c, line 149)
- Without this tempo, Ethernet will be at 10Mbs from SWD debug reset and ethernet operation will not be ensured from a power up  
- The duration is depending of the soft reset vs power up and of the ethernet switch auto-negotiation time (switch model, 100MB or 1GB)  
- Note : A delay may be already in lan8742.c on a newer package  

To configure cubeMX, read the ST tutorials :

### 6.3. RS485 does not work properly <a name="rs485_pb"></a>
See Termination and biasing resistors problem on the datasheet  

### 6.4. USB Bootloader does not work properly <a name="bootload_pb"></a>
There is a new problem which appeared with STM32CubeProgrammer, this error has been [reported](https://community.st.com/t5/stm32cubeprogrammer-mcus/stm32cubeprogrammer-2-14-0-firmware-update-error-over-usb-in/td-p/601282) on the forums in October 2023.  
The USB bootload stops during flashing when the bootload launch was done with a software jump.  
We have found that performing a "Verify" before "Download" significantly improves the probability of success.
